		I am a final year undergraduate pursuing B.Tech and M.Tech (dual degree) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. My current research interest is in machine learning. In my Bachelors Thesis under the supervision of Dr. Pabitra Mitra, I have worked on regularization methods for deep learning. Apart from deep learning I am also interested in the algorithmic and theoretical aspects of general machine learning.

		Prior to finding an interest in machine learning research, me and my team BitBees were actively taking part in competitive programming contests. Team Bitbees qualified for the ACM ICPC world finals in 2015 and 2016, but attended the finals only in 2015.
