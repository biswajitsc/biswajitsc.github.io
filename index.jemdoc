I am a third year PhD student in the [http://ml.cmu.edu Machine Learning Department] at [http://www.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University]. I am fortunate to be advised by [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/ Barnabás Póczos]. My broad area of interest is statistical machine learning and some aspects of deep learning. More specifically I am interested in Bayesian optimization, bandits, and more generally sequential decision making.

Prior to this I graduated from the [http://iitkgp.ac.in Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur] with a combined bachelors and masters in Computer Science and Engineering. I was advised by [http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pabitra/ Pabitra Mitra] for my undergraduate thesis.

Outside of work, I am a regular [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering boulderer] (≤ V4), and [https://www.deviantart.com/biswajitsc/gallery paint] on my iPad.
